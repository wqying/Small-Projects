# Small-Projects
Collection of small projects that I built in one sitting to sharpen my coding skills. Projects stored here are usually basic level or meme/unserious projects created on a whim.
Note that a separate folder named "SWLD Side Project" is more of a long term experimental neural network-based personal project that I'm making for the Southern Wind Lion Dance team.
